The rapid growth of e-commerce has revolutionized the way people shop, making it essential for businesses to have a reliable and user-friendly mobile application. This project focuses on the development of an e-commerce application using Android Studio and Firebase as the backend database.

The application also offers an admin panel for businesses to manage products, orders, and user accounts effectively.
Overall, this e-commerce application serves as a powerful tool for businesses to expand their online presence and enhance customer satisfaction. It empowers users with a convenient and secure platform to shop for their desired products, delivering a personalized and seamless shopping experience
